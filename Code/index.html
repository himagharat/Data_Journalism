          <h2>Poverty and the Uninsured:</h2>
          <p>Adults in low-income households are more likely to be uninsured than people in higher income households, but not all uninsured adults are in low income households. 
            For example, Texas has the highest number of uninsured adults, but does not have the highest number of families in poverty.

          <h2>Poverty and Smoking:</h2>
          <p>People living below the poverty line seem to have a higher smoking rate. 
            However, poverty does not appear to be the only factor that contributes to the likelihood of cigarette smoking as states like California and New York are in the median range in terms of poverty rates, but  have some of the lowest rates of smoking relative to their populations.

          <h2>Poverty and Obesity:</h2>
          <p>The United States has one of the highest obesity rates in the world- one third of the U.S. population is obese and the other third is overweight. 
            This may be so because people who live in impoverished areas have less access to fresh food and have to rely on “unhealthy” food sources. 
            However, poverty is not the only indicator of obesity as some states, such as New Hamphire, has low poverty rates but high obesity rates.

          <p>In comparison to other age groups, younger groups are more likely to go without insurance coverage. 
            This is the case for a multitude of reasons- younger people tend to be healthier than other age groups.

          <p>Older age groups seem to have a higher rate of smoking than other age groups. 
            This may be the case as individuals have smoked for many years and chose not to quit.

          <h2>Age and Obesity:</h2>
          <p>There does appear to be some correlation between a state’s median age and obesity level. 
            It seems that higher age groups are more likely to be obese, but that is not always the case. There are other factors, such as poverty and income that may affect obesity levels.
