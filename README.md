# Data Journalism

## Background:

Tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand my findings. 

The data set included is based on 2014 ACS from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

### Objective:
Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age using D3 techniques.
